MyForm.cpp has the Main function

I have tested the app extensively with different sets of data emphasising the app functionalty.

Unresolved issue with the App:
The space provided in the App, where we can edit the file manually accepts only numbers and comma in (number,number) format and for all combinations App fails and we need to select the file again. It doesnt accept white spaces too.
